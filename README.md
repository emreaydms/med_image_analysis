## Technical Highlights

### Advanced Mathematical Implementation

#### Custom PCA with Medical Image Optimization
```python
# Manual covariance computation without np.cov
X_centered = X_scaled - self.mean_
cov_matrix = np.dot(X_centered.T, X_centered) / (n_samples - 1)
eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eigh(cov_matrix)

# Optimal component selection and variance preservation
self.explained_variance_ratio_ = eigenvalues[:n_components] / np.sum(eigenvalues)
```

#### K-Means++ Smart Initialization
```python
# Probabilistic centroid selection for optimal convergence
distances = np.array([min([np.sum((point - c)**2) for c in centroids[:c_id]]) 
                     for point in X])
probabilities = distances / np.sum(distances)
# Select next centroid based on squared distance probability
```

#### Medical Image Quality Assessment
```python
def calculate_psnr(pred, true, eps=1e-4):
    mse = np.mean((pred - true) ** 2) + eps
    max_val = 255.0 if np.max(true) > 1.0 else 1.0
    return 10 * np.log10((max_val ** 2) / mse)
```
